Source code:

 - create hat in the following situation:

    * T=log
    * f is log-convex in unbounded domain [b,Inf)
    * log-density(Inf) is less than 0 and larger than Inf 

   same on (Inf,b]

Tests:

 - add more fancy examples

Man pages:

 - needs to be written
 - find fancy and/or convincing examples

 - there must no be any inflection point in intervals
   which are eithe unbounded or where the density vanishes
   at some boundary point!!
