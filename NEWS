	  of the log-density.

	  Fixed issue with densities on bounded domains
	  where the density vanishes on one boundary point and
	  its derivative on the other one.

	- new internal C functiond Tinflex_lib_sample_double():
	  returns one random number of type double.
	  This function is also exported at C level.
