Version 2.0: 2022-03-15

	- Tinflex.setup() and Tinflex.setup.C():
	  Argument "d2lpdf" is now optional.
	  If NULL, then a new variant of the method is used, that
	  determines intervals where the transformed density is
	  concave or convex without means of the second derivative
	  of the log-density.

	- internal: fixed issue with HTML5 code


Version 1.9: 2021-12-14

	- internal: new directory src/scripts
	

Version 1.8: 2021-11-15

	- Tinflex.setup.C():
	  Fixed issue with densities on bounded domains
	  where the density vanishes on one boundary point and
	  its derivative on the other one.

	- new internal C functiond Tinflex_lib_sample_double():
	  returns one random number of type double.
	  This function is also exported at C level.


Version 1.7: 2021-02-08

	- fixed URL in man pages
	

Version 1.6: 2021-02-08

	- new function Tinflex.setup.C():
	  the setup routine is implemented in pure R code.
	  The function returns an object of class "TinflexC"
	  (instead of class "Tinflex").

	- new function Tinflex.sample.C():
	  sampling routine for objects of class "TinflexC"
	  (However, routine Tinflex.sampling() also does work).

	- The C routines are now exported at C level and can be linked
          into other R packages.
